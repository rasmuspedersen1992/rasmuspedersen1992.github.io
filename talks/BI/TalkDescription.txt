Title:
Communicating mathematics with interactive visualizations: Examples of public communication about COVID-19

Short description of speaker: 
"Rasmus Kristoffer Pedersen is a mathematician and postdoctoral researcher at Roskilde University, Denmark. 
In his daily work, Rasmus works with mathematical modelling of epidemic diseases and how to communicate mathematical subjects to a broad audience."

Short description of talk:
Mathematics can help us understand the world around us. 
The COVID-19 pandemic made this clear, with mathematical predictions becoming part of the public discussion.
However, it can be difficult to communicate mathematical ideas and concepts in a way that everyone can understand.
Recently, Rasmus has published online communication-articles on mathematical subjects in which interactive visualizations embedded in the articles are a key component.
In his talk, Rasmus will talk about his personal experience with communicating mathematics, and how successful science communication plays an important role in his life as a researcher.
