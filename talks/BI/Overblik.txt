Plan:

- Introduction
- Intro to mechanism-based mathematical modelling.
- ("Why work on communication" (Student-recruitment / Communication with doctors / general public information about e.g. COVID-19))
- Exponential growth / Uncertainty 
- SIR-model, article illustration (Briefly, no need to talk about the lockdown-things in the simulation)
- SIR-model, agent-based simulation 
- Final comments 



IntroducÃ©r mig selv. 
Mekanism-based mathematical modelling: Taking simple ideas, describe them mathematically, see what the calculations tell us about the real world. 
(Might be conceptually different approach to data than most people in the room: Top-down from data vs bottom-up toward data)
A "good" mathematical model: Agrees with data, can be interpreted easily
Both are difficult, but the second part has an additional challenge: Interpretation by who?

It's not enough that my colleagues understand; other people must also "get it".
One way: Visualizations. My flavour of choice: Interactive visualizations.

COVID: 
- A wish to explain mathematical perspective on COVID. 
- "Videnskab.dk": Danish science-communication website. Subsection written by researchers themselves. 
(NOTE: In Danish, so figures are in Danish, sorry)
- SIR-model, or more accurately, exponential growth/decay.

- Alfa vs Delta graph. Theoretically -> Data (fig1 and fig2)
- Working a bit around with the equations -> Logistic-like growth from 0 to 1 (fig 3)
- Mathematical result (+ experience from Wuhan-strain to Alpha) said that slope at 50% was indicative of competitive advantage. Was in agreement with other studies. (Perhaps mention that its an absolute advantage, not relative)

Exponential growth and uncertainty

SIR-model, and the effect of lockdowns

Extra time: Viral-load figure
Extra time: Summer-prediction
If no time: Briefly show figures and mention how they were made: By hand ("Artisinal JavaScript"), Bokeh and Chart.js, respectively. 
Consider also including old agent-based SIR-model.

Conclusion:
Mechanism-based mathematical modelling is based on relative simple ideas about "the behaviour of stuff", but understanding the results is not always easy. 
Exponential growth is, fundamentally, difficult to grasp (for mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike)

Good visualization can make a huge difference in how data and mathematical results are understood. And ready-made tools like Bokeh can make it even easier for scientists to make use of the tools of data-visualization. 
However, just because a graph is interactive does not make it easy to understand.
Furthermore, an interacitve graph is not always the best tool for the task. [Even if an electronic screwdriver can be used to put in a nail, a hammer might still be preferable.] 
Focus should always be on *what* is being communicated, not *how* that thing is communicated.

		Using interactive visualizations embedded within online articles, Rasmus has recently written about subjects like mathematical uncertainty and COVID-19 modelling.
		Examples include an article on the next COVID-19-wave and a more general article on mathematical uncertainty.
